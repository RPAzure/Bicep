# Bicep
## Trying to Learn Bicep
This is my first crack at any Azure Programming.  Trying to learn how to deploy using Bicep.
My plan is to build different templates for each resource and test non stop till I can figure out the easiest way to deploy
From there, I am hoping to merge templates together to make one big template that would be used to create the basic Resources we use on a day to day basis
